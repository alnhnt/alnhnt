### Hi

- Iâ€™m a hobbyist in electronics, software and microcontrollers.
- My career quickly moved from Electronics to Datacomms Design, Consultancy and Project Management and delved into Office VBA for many years.
- In early retirement I'm back to the fun of BASIC with PICAXE microcontrollers, although there's aspirations of using Zig too.
- For now I'm learning Kotlin with Android and desktop, which follows a sponsored degree top-up in the noughties with OOP/Java.
