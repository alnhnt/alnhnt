### Hi

- Iâ€™m a hobbyist in electronics, software and microcontrollers.
- After leaving electronics and the ZX Spectrum in the 80's, I spent years with Office VBA and learnt some Java in the noughties.
- Now Iâ€™m back with PICAXE BASIC microcontrollers, perhaps extending to C and Zig, or moving to GCBASIC/B4R.  I'm also learning Kotlin for Android and desktop.
- ðŸ‘¯ It's for fun, to keep the brain cells going and to offer support if I can.
