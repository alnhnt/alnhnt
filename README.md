### Hi

- I’m a hobbyist in electronics, software and microcontrollers.
- Leaving electronics and the ZX Spectrum in the 80's, I had a HND and briefly did electronics before moving to Datacomms Design, Consultancy and Project Management.
- I developed and supported some fairly complex Office VBA apps for many years. In the nineties and noughties companies sponsored a Management Certificate and a Degree, where I focused on OOP and Java.
- Now I’m retired and back to the fun of BASIC with PICAXE microcontrollers.  Perhaps I'll extend to C and Zig in future, or GCBASIC/B4R.  For now I'm also learning Kotlin for Android and desktop.
- I like learning, so this is for fun, to keep the brain cells going and to offer support if I can.
